                <h2 id="challenge"> Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
                    <p>During the implementation of the <b>sitemap.html</b>, <b>userprofile.html</b>, and <b>content_ST04.html</b> pages, several challenges were encountered that provided valuable learning experiences.</p>
                    <p>One significant challenge was ensuring the responsiveness of the site map visualization in <b>sitemap.html</b>. The complex SVG structure required precise positioning and scaling to maintain clarity across different devices. This was resolved by extensively using CSS media queries and flexible SVG properties, allowing the site map to adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes. The lesson learned was the importance of thorough testing and iterative adjustments to achieve a responsive design that works well on all devices.</p>
                    <p>For the <b>userprofile.html</b> page, managing the interactive tabbed interface and form validation posed initial difficulties. The JavaScript logic for switching between tabs and validating form inputs had to be carefully implemented to ensure a smooth user experience. By breaking down the functionality into smaller, manageable functions and thoroughly testing each part, these challenges were overcome. This reinforced the value of modular coding and rigorous testing to ensure robust functionality.</p>
                    <p>In <b>content_ST04.html</b>, the challenge was to create a visually appealing and accessible layout for a large amount of content, including events, publications, and news. Using CSS Grid and Flexbox, a flexible and responsive layout was achieved. The lesson here was the effectiveness of modern CSS layout techniques in managing complex content structures while maintaining accessibility and usability.</p>
                    <p>Overall, these challenges highlighted the importance of patience, attention to detail, and continuous learning in web development. Each obstacle provided an opportunity to deepen understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ultimately leading to more resilient and user-friendly web pages.</p>

                <h2 id="compliance"> Compliance</h2>
                <p>The web pages created adhere to the regulations governing web page publication as outlined by Janet. These regulations emphasize the importance of accessibility, security, and user privacy. To ensure compliance, the following measures were taken</p> 
                <ol>
                    <li class="dec"><b>Accessibility:</b> The pages were designed with accessibility in mind, following the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). This includes the use of semantic HTML tags, alt text for images, and proper form labeling. Additionally, the pages were tested for color contrast and keyboard navigability to ensure they are usable by individuals with disabilities.</li>
                    <li class="dec"><b>Security:</b> To protect user data and ensure secure communication, the pages were designed to be served over HTTPS. This encrypts data transmitted between the user and the server, safeguarding sensitive information. Furthermore, the forms on the pages were designed with input validation to prevent common security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).</li>
                    <li class="dec"><b>User Privacy:</b> The pages do not collect or store personal information without explicit user consent. Any data collected through forms is handled in accordance with privacy laws and regulations. Users are informed about the data being collected and how it will be used, ensuring transparency and compliance with privacy standards.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>By adhering to these regulations, the web pages ensure a safe, accessible, and user-friendly experience for all visitors.</p>
